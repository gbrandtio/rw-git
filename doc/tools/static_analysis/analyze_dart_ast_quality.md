# analyze_dart_ast_quality

## Business Logic

Answers: "What breaks if we merge this Dart change?" Performs deep semantic analysis of up to 10 changed Dart files: dependency graph extraction, public API signature diff, dead code candidate identification, and import cycle detection. Scoped to a 10-file maximum to prevent performance degradation in large PRs.

## Algorithm

**DartAstAnalyzer** using `dart:analyzer` (the Dart SDK's official parser):

**Step 1 — Changed file identification:**
```
git merge-base <base> <target>
git diff --name-only <merge_base> <target>
```
Filter to `.dart` files. Abort if > 10 files (scope constraint).

**Step 2 — AST parsing (per file, in a Dart Isolate):**
`parseString(content: source, throwIfDiagnostics: false)` from `package:analyzer/dart/analysis/utilities.dart` produces a full `CompilationUnit` AST.

**Step 3 — AST visitor (`RecursiveAstVisitor<void>`):**
Walks the AST collecting:
- `visitImportDirective` — import URIs → `imports` list
- `visitClassDeclaration` — class names → `api_signatures`
- `visitMethodDeclaration` — public methods (no `_` prefix) → `api_signatures`; private → `internal_methods`
- `visitFunctionDeclaration` — top-level functions
- `visitMethodInvocation` — `{target: [method, ...]}` dependency graph; all method names → `invocations`

**Step 4 — Import cycle detection (Tarjan's SCC):**
Build a directed graph from the `imports` map collected across all analyzed files. Run **Tarjan's Strongly Connected Components algorithm**:
- DFS with a discovery-time stack and a "low-link" value per node
- When `lowlink[v] == disc[v]`, v is the root of an SCC
- Pop the stack to get all nodes in the SCC
- SCCs of size > 1 are circular import chains → reported in `import_cycles`

**Output per file:** `api_signatures`, `internal_methods`, `dependencies` graph, `invocations`, `imports`

**Output global:** `import_cycles` list (each cycle is a list of file paths forming a cycle)

### Aho, Lam, Sethi & Ullman (2006) — *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools* (Dragon Book, 2nd ed.)

**Published in:** Addison-Wesley

**Key claim:** Abstract Syntax Trees are the canonical internal representation for semantic analysis of source code. All non-trivial code analysis — type checking, dead code detection, dependency analysis — requires an AST rather than token-level processing.

**How rw-git uses it:** The decision to use `dart:analyzer`'s `parseString()` (which produces a full typed AST) rather than the FSM lexer is justified by this principle: the analyses performed (dependency graphs, import tracking, API signatures) require AST-level structural information that the FSM lexer cannot provide.

### Tarjan (1972) — *Depth-First Search and Linear Graph Algorithms*

**Published in:** SIAM Journal on Computing

**Key claim:** Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) of a directed graph can be identified in O(V + E) time using a single DFS pass with a discovery-time stack. Nodes in the same SCC can mutually reach each other — in an import graph, this means they form a circular dependency cycle.

**How rw-git uses it:** The `detectImportCycles` method implements Tarjan's algorithm to find all circular import chains among the analyzed files. SCCs of size > 1 are cycles. The O(V + E) complexity means the algorithm is practical even for large import graphs.

### Dig & Johnson (2006) — *How Do APIs Evolve? A Story of Refactoring*

**Published in:** Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution, Wiley

**Key claim:** 80% of API breakage in studied projects came from renaming and parameter changes — not from deletion. Detecting which public method signatures changed between branches requires an AST-level comparison of declared types and parameter lists.

**How rw-git uses it:** The `api_signatures` collection (class names + public method names) provides the surface for API breakage detection. A diff of `api_signatures` between base and target branch surfaces additions (safe) and removals / renames (breaking).

### Lakhotia (1993) — *Constructing Call Multigraphs Using k-CFA*

**Published in:** POPL, ACM

**Key claim:** The call graph (which function calls which) is the fundamental data structure for impact analysis — answering "if this function changes, what else might break?" Constructing it from an AST requires tracking method invocations as directed edges from caller to callee.

**How rw-git uses it:** The `dependencies` graph (target → [methods called on target]) is the tool's approximation of a call graph. It is underspecified (no type resolution, so target is a name not a type) but sufficient for identifying high-fan-in nodes — callers that depend on many external targets.

### Bacon & Sweeney (1996) — *Fast Static Analysis of C++ Virtual Function Calls*

**Published in:** OOPSLA, ACM

**Key claim:** Dead code (unreachable methods) can be identified statically by finding methods that never appear as the target of any invocation in the call graph.

**How rw-git uses it:** The `invocations` list (all methods called anywhere in the file) combined with `internal_methods` (all private methods defined in the file) enables a simple dead code check: internal methods not appearing in `invocations` are dead code candidates.

### Raemaekers, van Deursen & Visser (2012) — *Measuring Dependency Freshness in Software Systems*

**Published in:** MSR, IEEE

**Key claim:** Breaking API changes — where a public method is removed or its signature changes — are the primary source of downstream build failures. Detecting them at PR time rather than at integration time saves significant engineering time.

**How rw-git uses it:** The 10-file scope constraint exists precisely because AST-level analysis is expensive, and the most valuable use case is PR-time review of a small set of changed files, not batch analysis of an entire codebase.
